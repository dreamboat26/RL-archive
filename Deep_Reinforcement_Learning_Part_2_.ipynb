        "The REINFORCE algorithm involves learning a parametrized policy that produces action probabilities given states. Agents use this policy directly to act in an environment. The key idea is that during learning, actions that resulted in good outcomes should become more probable (these actions are positively reinforced). Conversely, actions that resulted in bad outcomes should become less probable. If learning is successful, over the course of many iterations action probabilities produced by the policy shift to distribution that results in a good performance in an environment.

        "A policy π is a function which maps states to action probabilities, which is used to sample an action a ∼ π(s). In REINFORCE, an agent learns a policy and uses this to act in an environment. A good policy is one that maximizes the cumulative discounted rewards. The key idea in the algorithm is to learn a good policy, and this means doing function approximation. Neural networks are powerful and flexible function approximators, so we can represent a policy using a deep neural network consisting of learnable parameters θ. This is often referred to as a policy network $π_θ$. We say that the policy is parametrized by θ. Each specific set of values of the parameters of the policy network represents a particular policy. Formulated in this way, the process of learning a good policy corresponds to searching for a good set of values for θ. For this reason, the policy network must be differentiable. We will see later in this notebook that the mechanism by which the policy is improved is through gradient ascent in parameter space.\n",

        "An objective can be understood as an agent’s goal, such as winning a game or getting the highest score possible.that an agent acting in an environment generates a trajectory, which contains a sequence of rewards along with the states and actions. A trajectory is denoted τ = $s_0, a_0,r_0,...,s_T,a_T,r_T$ .The return of a trajectory $R_t$(τ) is defined as a discounted sum of rewards from time step t to the end of a trajectory as shown below(Equation 2.1).\n",

        "The natural question which might now arise is that why do we need the discounted return? Why not just simply add all returns? The Answer is the return is task-oriented i.e. in some cases you might give equal priority to every return and in the other one return is more important than others. Different values of gamma(γ) have different effects on the agent. If we keep the value of gamma less than one then the agent is short-sighted i.e. it gives more priority to initial rewards than rewards obtained later in the time. And similarly, if the value of gamma if greater than one then the agent is far-sighted i.e. it gives more priority to rewards that are obtained later in time rather than initial rewards. The value of gamma depends on the tasks of the agent. We can have gamma equal to one in case we want to give equal priority to all rewards.\n",

Without a baseline, even when an agent produces a very good action, it gets discouraged because the returns are always negative. Over time, this can still result in good policies since worse actions will get discouraged even more and thus indirectly increase the probabilities of better actions. However, it can lead to slower learning because probability adjustments can only be made in a single direction. Likewise, the converse happens in environments where all the rewards are positive. A more effective way is to both increase and decreases the action probabilities directly. This requires having both positive and negative returns."
