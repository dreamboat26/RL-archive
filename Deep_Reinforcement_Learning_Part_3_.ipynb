Agents can calculate $Q^π(s, a)$ for each of the actions a ∈ $A_s$ available in a particular state s, and select the action with the maximum value. In the optimal case, $Q^π(s, a)$ represents the optimal expected value from taking action a in state s, denoted Q(s, a). It represents the best you could possibly do if you acted optimally in all subsequent states. Knowing Q(s, a) therefore yields an optimal policy.\n",

        "The disadvantage of learning $Q^π(s, a)$ is that the function approximation is more computationally complex, and requires more data to learn from when compared with $V^π(s)$. Learning a good estimate for $V^π(s)$ requires that the data covers the state space reasonably well, whereas learning a good estimate for $Q^π(s, a)$ requires that data covers all (s, a) pairs, not just all states s. The combined state-action space is often significantly larger than the state space and so more data is needed to learn a good Q-function estimate.\n",

        "$V^π(s)$ maybe a simpler function to approximate but it has one significant disadvantage. To use $V^π(s)$ to choose actions, agents need to be able to take each of the available actions a ∈ $A_s$ in a state s, and observe the next state the environment transitions to $s^{′2}$, along with the next reward r. Then an agent can act optimally by selecting the action which led to the largest expected cumulative discounted rewards E[r + $V^π$ (s′)]. However, if state transitions are stochastic (taking action a in state s can result in different next states s′) the agent may need to repeat this process many times to get a good estimation of the expected value of taking a particular action.

This follows from the definition of the Q-function since the expectation of future cumulative discounted rewards from a single example is just the cumulative discounted reward from the current time step to the end of the episode for that example. Equation 3.3 shows that this is also the Monte Carlo estimate for $Q^π(s, a)$ where the number of trajectories used in the estimate is equal to N = 1. Now each (s, a) pair in the dataset is associated with a target Q- value. The dataset can be said to be “labeled” since each datapoint (s, a) has a corresponding target value $Q^π_{tar}(s, a)$.\n",

        "If the environment is deterministic then it is correct to only consider the actual next state when calculating the expectation over the next states. However, if the environment is stochastic, this breaks down. Taking action a in states s could transition the environment into several different next states, but only one next state was actually observed at each step. This problem can be overcome by considering only one example — the one that actually happened. This does mean that the Q-value estimate may have high variance if the environment is stochastic, but helps make the estimation more tractable. Using just one example to estimate the distribution over the next states s′ and rewards s, we can take the outer expectation out and the Bellman equation can be rewritten as shown below in Equation 3.5.\n",

There are two ways to solve this, each of which corresponds to a different algorithm; SARSA and DQN(DQN will be discussed in Notebook-4 of this series).SARSA’s solution is to use the action actually taken in the next state, a′ (Equation 3.6).

TD learning only uses the actual reward r, from the next state s′, and combines it with Q-value estimates to approximate the remaining part of the value.

This also implies that the SARSA algorithm is limited to discrete action spaces(To identify the maximum Q-value in state s, we need to compute the Q-values for all the possible actions in that state. When actions are discrete, this is straightforward because we can list all the possible actions and compute their Q-value. However, when actions are continuous, the actions cannot be fully enumerated, and this becomes a problem. For this reason, SARSA and other value-based methods are generally restricted to only discrete action spaces. However, there are methods such as QT– Opt which approximate the maximum Q-value by sampling from a continuous action space. We will not cover QT-Opt in this series).\n",

        "# Exploration and Exploitation\n",
        "One issue with acting greedily with respect to the Q-values is that it is deterministic, which means that an agent may not explore the entire state-action space sufficiently. If an agent always selects the same action a in state s, then there may be many (s, a) pairs that an agent never experiences. This can result in the Q-function estimates for some (s, a) pairs being inaccurate since they were randomly initialized and there were no experiences of (s, a). So there is no opportunity for a network to learn about this part of the state-action space. Consequently, the agent may make suboptimal actions and get stuck in local minima.\n",

        "To mitigate this issue, it is common to use an ∊-greedy policy instead of a purely greedy policy for the agent. Under this policy, an agent selects the greedy action with probability 1 – ∊, and acts randomly with probability ∊. So ∊ is known as the exploration probability since the acting randomly ∊× 100% of the time helps an agent explore the state-action space. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost. Now the policy may not be as good as the greedy policy because the agent is taking random actions with non-zero probability instead of the Q-value maximizing action.\n",

A common approach to managing this trade-off is to start with high ∊, 1.0, or close to this so that the agent acts almost randomly and rapidly explores the state-action space. Also, the agent has not learned anything at the beginning of training so there is nothing to exploit. Overtime ∊ is gradually decayed so that after many steps the policy hopefully approaches the optimal policy. As the agent learns better Q-function and so better policies, there is less benefit to exploring and the agent should act more greedily. In the ideal case, the agent will have discovered the optimal Q- function after some time and so ∊ can be reduced to 0. In practice, due to limited time, continuous or high dimensional discrete state spaces, and non-linear function approximators the learned Q-function does not converge to the optimal policy. Instead ∊ is typically annealed to a small value, \n",

This involves a forward pass through the value network to obtain the Q-value estimates for all of the (s, a) pairs. Recall that in the SARSA version of the Bellman equation, we use the action actually taken by the agent in the next state to calculate.So we repeat the same step with next states instead of states.Next, we extract the Q-value estimate for the action actually taken in both cases.With this, we can estimate $Q_{tar}(s,a)$.\n",
